			<h2>About Alex Ford</h2>
			<p>Thomas Alexander Ford, goes by the name "Alex."  Grew up in a small town in Indiana called Coatesville.  Growing up near Pittsboro, IN, Alex's first love was motor sports and watching his first hero, Jeff Gordon, have a very successful NASCAR career. </p>
            <p>When Alex was 12 years old he picked up a bass guitar for the first time and completely fell in love with music.  His passion for music outweighs his enjoyment of sports.  He went on to teach himself acoustic guitar, electric guitar, vocals, and to an extent, drums. </p>
            <p>His other joy besides music, is to just be around people.  Meet them, talk with them, and get to know some more. </p>
            <p>Mr. Ford hopes you will enjoy his band's music as much as he does and hopes he will see you at one the upcoming shows.</p>
